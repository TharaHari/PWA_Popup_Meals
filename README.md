# ES6 Static Site Renderer ... With Markdown

Simplest way that I could think of to generate a static site with ES6 templates.

## Quick Start

With [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

npm install
npm start

Right click over `index.html` and Open with Live Server.
